<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This series of katas will introduce you to basics of doing geometry with computers.

Point objects have x, y attributes. Triangle objects have attributes a, b, c describing their corners, each of them is a Point.

Write a function calculating perimeter of a Triangle defined this way.

Tests round answers to 6 decimal places.
